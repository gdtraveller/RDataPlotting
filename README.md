# RDataPlotting
R Exploratory Data Analysis course 1 project repository

Create four R code files. Each code file will create a PNG file that reconstructs the plots for the course 1 project.

Each PNG file is created with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
The names of the PNG files are plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png and plot4.png.
The plot1.R code file constructs the plot1.png PNG file.
The plot2.R code file constructs the plot2.png PNG file.
The plot3.R code file constructs the plot3.png PNG file.
The plot4.R code file constructs the plot4.png PNG file.
Each code file includes the code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced.
